Webapp to rate songs within an artist's discography 

Created at Carthage College as a Computing Paradigms course assigment. The assignment was to create any deployable Ruby app and publish it via Heroku. Since the completion of the course, this has not been modified or upkept. The app is still being hosted on Heroku here: http://radiant-river-4505.herokuapp.com

Ruby connects to the MusicBrains collection of artist data, so if it can be found there, it'll be found here!
Search for an artist, wait ~6 seconds for two songs by the artist to appear, select your favorite! Load up another song's information, rinse and repeat!

Data collected could be used to find favorite songs within an artist's discography
